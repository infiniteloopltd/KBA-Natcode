# KBA-Natcode

This is an open-source app written in Swift that allows users in Germany and Austria look up the KBA or Natcode
of vehicles. It also has a VIN decoder for anyone who has the patience to type a 17 letter code into an app!

There are four keys that are not included in this app, that you will need to obtain these as follows:

* For access to the KBA/Natcode decoder API, you will need an account on [KBAAPI.de](http://www.kbaapi.de) or [Natcode.at](http://www.natcode.at)
* For access to the Bing API, you will need to get this from [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/try/cognitive-services/)
* For access to the Remote Log Cat, you will need a key from [RemoteLogCat](http://www.remotelogcat.com)

The completed app is available from [iTunes](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/kba-und-natcode/id1378122352?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000l9tW)
